<h1>Off-the-Record Messaging with libotr</h1>

<p>
  A commonly used method for sending messages to others when you need
  authentication and privacy is to use an OpenPGP tool such as GNU
  Privacy Guard (GnuPG). For real time communications such as instant
  messaging, IRC, and socket IO, using Off The Record (OTR) messaging
  provides <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy">Perfect
  Forward Secrecy</a> and secure identification of the remote party
  without the need for a web of trust.
</p>

<p>
  In order to operate without a web of trust <a
  href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">libotr</a> implements the
  Socialist Millionaires' Protocol (SMP). The SMP allows two parties
  to verify that they both know the same secret. The secret might be a
  passphrase or answer to a private joke that two people will easily
  know. The SMP operates fine in the presence of eaves droppers (who
  don't get to learn the secret). Active communications tampering is
  not a problem, though of course it might cause the protocol not to
  complete succesfully.
</p>

<p>
  Because the SMP doesn't rely on the fingerprint of the user's
  private key for authentication, the private key becomes almost an
  implementation detail. Once generated, the user generally doesn't
  need to know about the key or it's fingerprint. The only time a user
  really cares to know is when a key is created because a bit of
  entropy has to go into that process. Of course, an application
  should avoid regenerating keys for no reason because each time the
  key is replaced the user has to use the SMP again to allow remote
  parties to authenticate them.
</p>

<p>
  In this article I'll show you how to use the current release, libotr
  3.2.0+, to provide OTR messaging. I'll present two examples which
  are both in C++ and use the boost library for socket IO. I have gone
  this was so we can focus on the OTR action and not the details of
  sockets.
</p>

<p>
  The first example does not use the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol
  (SMP). So the new_fingerprint() callback is essential to
  establishing a secure session. When not using the SMP,
  authentication is performed by comparing the sent fingerprints of
  those you are wishing to communicate with against known good values.
  These known values must be sent beforehand through a secure
  secondary channel, such as a face to face meeting. Once fingerprints
  have been accepted, subsequent OTR comminications with the same
  party can be performed without explicit fingerprint verification.
</p>

<p>
  The second example makes things simpler for the user by using the
  SMP for authentication of the remote party. This way, the
  information exchanged beforehand becomes shared experiences you and
  the other party have had such that a question can be raised that
  only you and they can easily answer.
</p>

<p>
  A central abstraction in using the libotr library is the struct
  s_OtrlMessageAppOps vtable. This is used by libotr to callback into
  your code when something happens such as a crytpographic fingerprint
  being received, or libotr wanting to send a message to the other
  end. The later happens frequently during OTR session establishment.
</p>

<p>
  If a program monitors it's socket IO using select() or some other
  mainloop abstraction, then having these internal protocol messages
  being sent is not so much of an issue. Alas, for the simple echo
  server I present one must remember that there might be one or more
  internal OTR protocol messages sent from what seems like outside of
  the normal program flow. I'll get back to this point while
  describing the relevant section of the first example.
</p>

<p>
  Many of the callback functions in s_OtrlMessageAppOps might be
  simple stubs, but you should be aware of inject_message() which will
  be called when libotr itself wants to send something, notify and
  display_otr_message can both provide feedback to the user, the
  new_fingerprint() method is called when a remote key is discovered
  in order to allow you to inform the user and possibly abort the
  session. The gone_secure() method is called to allow you to inform
  the user that they are off the record. When you call libotr
  functions you supply both a pointer to a s_OtrlMessageAppOps
  structure <tt>uiops</tt> and a void* <tt>opdata</tt>. When libotr calls a method
  in uiops it will pass <tt>opdata</tt> back to you. 
</p>

<p>
  Another common three parameters you will pass to libotr functions
  are the accountname, protocol and sender or receiver name. The
  protocol string can be anything as long as both ends of the system
  use the same protocol string. The state data that libotr uses is
  stored in an OtrlUserState object which is created with
  otrl_userstate_create() and passed to many of the libotr functions
  along the way.
</p>

<p>
 The code below loads a private key or creates a new one if none
 already exists. Because creating a new key is an entropy heavy
 operation, the setupKey() function warns the user that if they are
 erratic it the process might move along a bit quicker. Note that the
 uiops has a callback create_privkey to generate a key if needed. I
 just prefer to make this codepath explicit and out of the main
 callback logic.
</p>

<pre>
bool ok( gcry_error_t et )
{
    return gcry_err_code(et) == GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR;
}

void setupKey( const std::string& filename )
{
    gcry_error_t et;
    
    et = otrl_privkey_read( userstate, filename.c_str() );
    if( !ok(et) )
    {
        cerr << "can't find existing key, generating a new one!" << endl;
        cerr << "this needs a bunch of entropy from your machine... so please" << endl;
        cerr << "move the mouse around and slap some keys mindlessly for a while" << endl;
        cerr << "a message will be printed when keys have been made..." << endl;
        et = otrl_privkey_generate( userstate, filename.c_str(),
                                    accountname, protocol );
        if( !ok(et) )
        {
            cerr << "failed to write new key file at:" << filename << endl;
        }
        cerr << "Have keys!" << endl;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
  The main.cpp program implements both the client and server. The
  server mode is selected by passing -s at startup. Firstly, a
  userstate is created, some variables set depending on if we are a
  client or server, and the correct private key is loaded or created.
</p>

<pre>
    OTRL_INIT;
    userstate = otrl_userstate_create();

    keyfile = "client.key";
    accountname = "client";
    recipientname = "server";
    if( ServerMode )
    {
        keyfile = "server.key";
        accountname = "server";
        recipientname = "client";
    }
    setupKey( keyfile );
</pre>

<p>
  The core logic for the echo client is to read a string from the user, send it to the
  server, grab a reply from the server and show it to the user.
  The start of the client code connects to a given port on localhost
  and reads a string from the user.
</p>

<pre>
        VMSG << "client mode..." << endl;
        stringstream portss;
        portss << Port;
        iosockstream stream( "127.0.0.1", portss.str() );
        if (!stream)
        {
            cerr << "can't connect to server!" << endl;
            exit(1);
        }

        string s;
        while( true )
        {
            getline(cin,s);
            cerr << "your raw message:" << s << endl;
            cerr << "send plaintext:" << colorsend(s) << endl;
</pre>

<p>
  We certainly do not want to send the raw string <tt>s</tt> over the wire to
  the server though. That would very much be "on the record". So the
  next fragment of the client gets libotr to encrypt the string <tt>s</tt> so
  we can send it off the record to the server. The userstate is the
  value created during program initialization using
  otrl_userstate_create(). The ui_ops is the vtable
  s_OtrlMessageAppOps structure described above, and opdata is the
  value we want libotr to pass back to our methods in ui_ops when it
  uses them. In this case, we use the address of the iostream for the socket as the
  opdata so callbacks can send and receive data on the socket if they
  so desire. The newmessage will point to an off-the-record message
  that the server can decrypt to read the string <tt>s</tt>. The tests on the
  return value for message_sending() ensure that we have a new,
  encrypted off the record message to send instead of the plaintext
  <tt>s</tt>.
</p>

<pre>
void* opdata = &stream;
OtrlTLV* tlvs = 0;
gcry_error_t et;
char* newmessage;

void* opdata = &stream;
OtrlTLV* tlvs = 0;
gcry_error_t et;
char* newmessage;

et = otrl_message_sending( userstate, &ui_ops, opdata,
                           accountname, protocol, recipientname,
                           s.c_str(), tlvs, &newmessage,
                           myotr_add_appdata, &ui_ops );
cerr << "encoded... ok:" << ok(et) << endl;
if( !ok(et) )
{
    cerr << "OTR message_sending() failed!" << endl;
}
if( ok(et) && !newmessage )
{
    cerr << "There was no error, but an OTR message could not be made." << endl;
    cerr << "perhaps you need to run some key authentication first..." << endl;
}
if( newmessage )
{
    VMSG << "have new OTR message:" << newmessage << endl;
    s = newmessage;
}
</pre>

<p>
  Since we have replaced the plaintext <tt>s</tt> with the off the record
  version, we send that to the server using the socket iostream and
  then wait a moment before reading a response. The while loop is
  slightly hairy in that it will block for new messages if we are not
  secure. As I mentioned above, libotr can call the inject_message()
  callback to write a new off the record message to the socket.
  Outgoing messages will be generated and injected during session
  establishment. There is no incoming version of inject_message() so
  the client needs to keep reading these injected messages before it
  tries to send another off the record message. One will find that
  there are many messages exchanged between libotr at each end when
  the string <tt>s</tt> is written to the socket. This only happens the first
  time through to setup the OTR protocol.
</p>

<p>
  When reading messages from the server, the encrypted string is read
  and passed to otrl_message_receiving(). If the recevied message was
  an OTR message that was sent from the other end by libotr using
  inject_message() then otrl_message_receiving() will indicate to the
  client that it should simply ignore this message. Otherwise a real
  message was encrypted and sent by the server and so the client will
  show the user the decrypted newmessage.
</p>

<pre>
cerr << "WRITE:" << s << endl;
stream << s << endl;
usleep( 200 * 1000 );
while( !secure && stream.peek() != std::iostream::traits_type::eof()
       || secure && stream.rdbuf()->available() )
{
    s = "junk";
    VMSG << "reading data from server" << endl;
    getline(stream,s);
    VMSG << "READ:" << s << endl;

    int ignore_message = otrl_message_receiving(
        userstate, &ui_ops, opdata,
        accountname, protocol, recipientname,
        s.c_str(),
        &newmessage,
        &tlvs,
        myotr_add_appdata, &ui_ops );

    VMSG << "ignore:" << ignore_message << " newmsg:" << maybenull(newmessage) << endl;
    if( ignore_message )
    {
        VMSG << "libotr told us to ignore this message..." << endl;
        VMSG << "available:" << stream.rdbuf()->available() << endl;
        VMSG << " in_avail:" << stream.rdbuf()->in_avail() << endl;
        
        continue;
    }
    if( newmessage )
        s = newmessage;
    otrl_message_free( newmessage );

    cout << color( s ) << endl;
}
</pre>

<p>
  Server mode is handled by a thread which executes server_session()
using the std::iostream for the new socket. 
</p>

<pre>
if( ServerMode )
{
    VMSG << "server mode..." << endl;

    boost::asio::io_service io_service;
    tcp::acceptor a( io_service, tcp::endpoint( tcp::v4(), Port ));
    for (;;)
    {
        h_iosockstream stream(new iosockstream());
        a.accept( *(stream->rdbuf()) );
        boost::thread t(boost::bind(server_session, stream));
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
The server implementation would look like the below if OTR messaging
was not being used.
</p>

<pre>
void server_session( h_iosockstream streamptr )
{
    iosockstream& stream = *(streamptr.get());
    while( stream )
    {
       std::string s;
       getline( stream,s );
       cout << "server got:" << s << endl;
       stream << s << endl;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
  The OTR server implementation starts out the same way, reading a
  string from the socket. Then our old friend otrl_message_receiving()
  is called to decrypt that message. If ignore_message is set then
  there is nothing to be done and we simply continue to the top of the
  loop to read another string from the client. Also, if we are not yet
  secure, there is no point in trying to send a new OTR message back
  to the client, so we simply continue at the top of the while loop
  again. This way we avoid writing replies to the client when session
  establishment messages are sent by libotr on the client side.
</p>

<p>
  This might seem a little strange at first, how will we ever become
  secure and start replying to the client if all we do is read from
  them and throw away the messages. The thing to keep in mind is that
  messages sent with inject_message() on the client will be seen by
  libotr when we call otrl_message_receiving() which in turn might
  cause libotr on the server to inject_message() with a reply to this
  session establishment message. Eventually libotr will call the
  gone_secure() OtrlMessageAppOps callback in which we set the global
  variable <tt>secure</tt> to true, this allowing the server to start replying to the
  client as it normally would.
</p>

<pre>
void server_session( h_iosockstream streamptr )
{
    iosockstream& stream = *(streamptr.get());
    while( stream )
    {
        gcry_error_t et;
	std::string s;
	VMSG << "getting more data from the client..." << endl;
	getline( stream,s );
	VMSG << "READ:" << s << endl;
                    
	void* opdata = &stream;
	OtrlTLV* tlvs = 0;
	char *newmessage = NULL;
	int ignore_message = otrl_message_receiving(
	   userstate, &ui_ops, opdata,
	   accountname, protocol, recipientname,
	   s.c_str(),
	   &newmessage,
	   &tlvs,
	   myotr_add_appdata, &ui_ops );

	VMSG << "ignore:" << ignore_message << " newmsg:" << maybenull(newmessage) << endl;
	if( newmessage )
   	    s = newmessage;
	otrl_message_free( newmessage );
	if( ignore_message )
	{
	    VMSG << "libotr told us to ignore this message..." << endl;
	    continue;
	}
                
	cout << "ignore:" << ignore_message << " server got:" << s << endl;
	cout << "message from client:" << color(s) << endl;

	// do not echo back messages when we are establishing the session
	if( !secure )
	    continue;
</pre>

<p>
  The remainder of server_session() creates the echo reply message,
  encrypts it with otrl_message_sending() and sends the OTR message
  over the socket.
</p>

<pre>
  static int count = 0;
  stringstream zz;
  zz << "back to you s:" << s << " count:" << count++;
  s = zz.str();
  cout << "writing...s:" << s << endl;
  cerr << "send plaintext:" << colorsend(s) << endl;

  et = otrl_message_sending( userstate, &ui_ops, opdata,
     accountname, protocol, recipientname,
     s.c_str(), tlvs, &newmessage,
     myotr_add_appdata, &ui_ops );
  if( !ok(et) )
  {
     cerr << "OTR message_sending() failed!" << endl;
  }
  if( ok(et) && !newmessage )
  {
     cerr << "There was no error, but an OTR message could not be made." << endl;
     cerr << "perhaps you need to run some key authentication first..." << endl;
  }
  if( newmessage )
  {
     VMSG << "have new OTR message:" << newmessage << endl;
     s = newmessage;
  }
                
  VMSG << "writing otr...s:" << s << endl;
  stream << s << endl;
</pre>


<p>
  As the security of the OTR messaging relies on fingerprints in the
  first example, the new_fingerprint callback presents our fingerprint
  and the remote fingerprint and asks the user if they want to
  continue to establish the session or not. Unforuntately this means
  the user has to eyeball scan the remote fingerprint against an
  expected value they have obtained from the remote party at some
  other time in a secure channel.
</p>

<pre>
static void myotr_new_fingerprint( void *opdata, OtrlUserState us,
                                   const char *accountname, const char *protocol,
                                   const char *username, unsigned char fingerprint[20])
{
    cerr << "myotr_new_fingerprint(top)" << endl;

    char our_fingerprint[45];
    if( otrl_privkey_fingerprint( us, our_fingerprint, accountname, protocol) )
    {
        cerr << "myotr_new_fingerprint() our   human fingerprint:" << embold( our_fingerprint ) << endl;
    }
    
    cerr << "myotr_new_fingerprint() their human fingerprint:"
         << embold( fingerprint_hash_to_human( fingerprint )) << endl;
    cerr << "do the fingerprints match at the remote end (enter YES to proceed)" << endl;
    std::string reply;
    getline( cin, reply );
    if( reply != "YES" )
    {
        cerr << "You have chosen not to continue to talk to these people... good bye." << endl;
        exit(0);
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Simpler authentication with SMP</h2>

<p>
  The second example uses the SMP to avoid having to verify
  fingerprints. For good measure, the fingerprints established are
  saved and loaded to/from disk so that subsequent conversations do
  not need any SMP or user fingerprint verification.
</p>

<p>
  During process startup, fingerprints are read from file if they exist;
</p>

<pre>
 std::stringstream fn;
 fn << "fingerprints-" << accountname;
 gcry_error_t e = otrl_privkey_read_fingerprints( userstate, fn.str().c_str(), 0, 0 );
</pre>

<p>
  The otrl_message_sending() and otrl_message_receiving() functions
  both have a parameter <tt>OtrlTLV *tlvs</tt>. The tlvs allow data to be
  sent and received as sideband information that does not effect what
  you send with libotr. The SMP uses the tlvs to communicate the
  information that it needs in order to authenticate.
</p>

<p>
  In server_session() the main change is a check on the tlvs variable
  after calling otrl_message_receiving().
</p>

<pre>
 if( tlvs )
 {
    handle_smp( stream, tlvs, userstate, &extended_ui_ops, opdata );
 }
</pre>

<p>
  The client initiates the SMP and has heavier changes to it's code.
  After creating a iosockstream to localhost, the client calls
  run_smp_client() to setup the OTR session and run the SMP to
  authenticate. Apart from the call to run_smp_client() the client
  mainloop while(true) doesn't need to change. This makes sense
  because the SMP is normally only used at session establishment when
  we do not know about the remote key (fingerprint) already.
</p>

<p>
  In the run_smp_client function, the first <tt>while( !secure...</tt> loop
  will establish an OTR session using fingerprints just like the first
  example. This time we do not stop to ask the user to verify the
  fingerprints, we simply record that a new fingerprint was
  seen. This is done by setting runSMP=true to force the SMP if we are
  using a fingerprint that we didn't already have on disk.
</p>

<p>
   If runSMP is set then we read a secret from the user and call
   otrl_message_initiate_smp() to get the SMP ball rolling with
   libotr. This leads to the second <tt>while( !secure</tt> loop which will
   stop when we are secure again.
</p>

<pre>
void run_smp_client( iosockstream& stream )
{
    void* opdata = &stream;
    OtrlTLV* tlvs = 0;

    // establish session using fingerprints
    stream << "?OTR?v2?" << endl;
    usleep( 200 * 1000 );
    while( !secure && stream.peek() != std::iostream::traits_type::eof() )
        client_read_msg_from_server( stream );

    if( !runSMP )
    {
        return;
    }
    
    VMSG << "Starting the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol " << endl
         << " to work out who the other guy is..." << endl
         << endl;
    VMSG << "please give me a secret that only you and the other guy know..." << endl;
    std::string s;
    getline( cin, s );
    int add_if_missing = true;
    int addedp = 0;
    ConnContext* smpcontext = otrl_context_find( userstate,
                                                 recipientname, accountname, protocol,
                                                 add_if_missing, &addedp,
                                                 myotr_add_appdata, &ui_ops );

    cerr << "addedp:" << addedp << " smpcontext:" << smpcontext << endl;
    if( !smpcontext )
        return;
    otrl_message_initiate_smp( userstate, &ui_ops, opdata, smpcontext,
                               (const unsigned char*)s.c_str(), s.length() );

    // we are only secure if the SMP succeeds
    secure = 0;
    while( !secure && stream.peek() != std::iostream::traits_type::eof() )
        client_read_msg_from_server( stream );
        
    cerr << "secure:" << secure << endl;
    if( secure == SMP_BAD )
    {
        cerr << "couldn't authenticate server, exiting..." << endl;
        exit(1);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
  The client_read_msg_from_server() function calls
  otrl_message_receiving() and checks if tlvs is set and if so calls
  handle_smp() with that tlvs value.
</p>

<p>
  As you see from the above, whenever a tlvs is set in the client or
  server then handle_smp() is called. If you look at the UPGRADING
  file in libotr 3.2.0+ you will see a skeleton code in "3.3.4.
  Control Flow and Errors" which the handle_smp() is based on. The
  handle_smp() function uses otrl_tlv_find() on tlvs to check for
  internal OTR messages sent from libotr itself which describe a stage
  in the SMP. handle_smp() is like a primitive state machine working
  through from SMP1 (the server asking for the secret to respond to
  the client's initial request), through to SMP3 and SMP4 which are
  called when the protocol completes with either success or failure
  (same or different secrets).
</p>

<pre>
  if( tlv = otrl_tlv_find(tlvs, OTRL_TLV_SMP2))
  {
    if (nextMsg != OTRL_SMP_EXPECT2)
    {
       cerr << "smp: spurious SMP2 received, aborting" << endl;
       otrl_message_abort_smp( userstate, ui_ops, opdata, smpcontext);
       otrl_sm_state_free(smpcontext->smstate);
    }
    else
    {
       cerr << embold("SMP2 received, otrl_message_receiving will have sent SMP3") << endl;
       smpcontext->smstate->nextExpected = OTRL_SMP_EXPECT4;
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
  If the secrets are proven to be the same when the SMP is used it is
  adventagious to save the fingerprints to disk so that future
  communications do not require user fingerprint verificaiton or the
  SMP.
</p>

   Hopefully you are now in a better position to add libotr support to
   your real time network programs. The full source code to these
   programs is up on <a href="https://github.com/monkeyiq">my
   github</a> page. Remeber, using off the record messaging doesn't
   nessesarily mean you have something to hide, just that you have
   nothing to show.
